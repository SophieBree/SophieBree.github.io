      <p>
        I'm a junior developer working in Sydney. I'm interested in solving
        problems, creative thinking, and working together with others to create
        things to improve people's lives. I've always been interested in tech,
        and recently decided to get serious about breaking into the industry as
        a web developer.

        In my spare time, I like to read books about the world, learn new things
        to improve my general knowledge and become more informed, and play
        Teamfight Tactics (TFT). TFT is a popular competitive strategy game, and
        if I can brag a little, I'm pretty good at it. My peak rank in
        the game was Grandmaster (about the top 0.03%!) and I've played in
        online tournaments against the best players in Oceania.
